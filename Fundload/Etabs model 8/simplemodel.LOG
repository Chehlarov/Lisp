 THE STRUCTURE IS UNSTABLE OR ILL-CONDITIONED !!
 CHECK THE STRUCTURE CAREFULLY FOR:
 - INADEQUATE SUPPORT CONDITIONS, OR
 - ONE OR MORE INTERNAL MECHANISMS, OR
 - ZERO OR NEGATIVE STIFFNESS PROPERTIES, OR
 - EXTREMELY LARGE STIFFNESS PROPERTIES, OR
 - BUCKLING UNDER P-DELTA LOADS (IF ANY), OR
 - AN EIGEN SHIFT (IF ANY) ONTO A NATURAL FREQUENCY
